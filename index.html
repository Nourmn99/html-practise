<p>In todays introduction we got some information and insights about the course and what to expect from the coming 6 weeks. We started the day off by introducing ourselves to each other and to give our opinions what to expect from this 6 week long course. After introducing ourselves to each other we installed the necessary programs needed for this course like Discord and a default browser. The animator gave us 2 tasks. 1: Create a professional email account. 2: make a linkedin or GitHub account. These 2 tasks are necessary for this 6 week long journey. After completing those tasks we got to play whoâ€™s who on Discord in order to get familiar with the Application. It was really fun. For the last task we got to make a Google drive document a ugly as possible so yes this might be one ugly looking piece of work.</p>
